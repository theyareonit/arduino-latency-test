/-------------------------/

Mode can be click or motion

"threshold" is the noise filtering threshold. Note that this is *in addition* to some noise filtering that is present by default.

"trials" must be greater than 100 for the csv to be viewable in MouseTester.

The amount of horizontal distance to move is determined by "move_distance", and can be between -128 and 127. I don't know what the units mean.

"time_between_inputs" is a minimum, the actual average time between inputs will be higher.

"start_delay" is the delay before starting a test in seconds.
